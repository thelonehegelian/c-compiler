**Project Title:** C Subset Compiler in Python (just for fun and learning)

**Description:**

This repository houses the development of a full-featured compiler implemented in Python, capable of translating source code written in a subset of the C programming language into executable machine code. The goal of this project is to provide an accessible and educational resource for individuals interested in understanding the fundamental concepts of compiler construction and programming language translation.

**TODOs**

- [x] Lexer
- [ ] Parser (in progress)
- [ ] Error Handling

**Key Features:**

1. **Lexical Analysis:** The compiler includes a lexer that breaks down the source code into a stream of tokens, identifying keywords, identifiers, constants, and operators.

2. **Syntax Parsing:** A robust parser is implemented using top-down parsing techniques to create a parse tree from the tokenized input.

3. **Semantic Analysis:** The compiler performs semantic analysis to check for type compatibility, variable scoping, and other semantic rules to ensure the correctness of the source code.

6. **Code Generation:** Finally, it translates the intermediate code into machine code for the target architecture, making it ready for execution.

7. **Subset of C:** This compiler focuses on a well-defined subset of the C programming language, including essential features like variables, control structures, and functions.

**Usage:**

Developers and students interested in compilers and programming language design can use this project as a learning resource. The repository includes example source code written in the subset of C, along with detailed documentation explaining the compilation process.

**Contributions:**

Contributions and feedback from the open-source community are highly encouraged. Whether you want to improve the compiler's functionality, add new features, or fix bugs, please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit pull requests.
